# Change Log

Notable changes to 3scale Istio Mixer Adapter will be tracked in this document.

## 0.6.0 - 2019-05-02

## Added

- The [OpenID Connect](https://github.com/3scale/3scale-istio-adapter/blob/v0.6.0/README.md#openid-connect-pattern) authentication pattern is now supported via Istio's [end user authn](https://istio.io/help/ops/security/end-user-auth/) and the CLI tool to generate templates can now generate an instance template supporting this pattern. The hybrid pattern has been updated to include OIDC as well. (#[89](https://github.com/3scale/3scale-istio-adapter/pull/89))

## Changed

- The CLI tool enables the so-called "fixup" mode when no explicit unique id is
  specified, so that automatic generation of identifierss from URLs are modified
  to comply with k8s format and rules. Now calling the tool without the --uid
  option will autoenable the --fixup one. ([#91](https://github.com/3scale/3scale-istio-adapter/pull/91))

## 0.5.1 - 2019-04-09

### Fixed

- The templates generated by the CLI tool now reference the right instance
  ([#84](https://github.com/3scale/3scale-istio-adapter/pull/84))
- The templates generated by the CLI tool use lower case to match headers
  ([#83](https://github.com/3scale/3scale-istio-adapter/pull/83))
- A segmentation fault caused by freeing a null pointer has been fixed by
  updating the 3scale backend client library to a newer release.
  ([#81](https://github.com/3scale/3scale-istio-adapter/issues/81), [#82](https://github.com/3scale/3scale-istio-adapter/pull/82))

### Added

- The adapter now prints out its version when running and the adapter Deployment
  definition is now generated by a script.
  ([#80](https://github.com/3scale/3scale-istio-adapter/pull/80))
- Documentation updates for Istio 1.1

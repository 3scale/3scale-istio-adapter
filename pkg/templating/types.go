package templating

/*
The templating package exposes functionality that is used to generate CustomResource manifests for
an out-of-process adapter. To route your application traffic for a service within Istio mesh through Mixer and
in turn an OOP adapter three different custom resources are required. The templating package can be used to generate these:
handler, instance and service.

This package is bound to Istio 1.1 specific attributes.
